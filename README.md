# Data-Learning
Dimensionality reduction, Data assimilation and Domain decomposition.

The objective is to test the performance of PCA and encoder for wildfire data compression. Then compare their performance for assimilation using Kalman Filters. Finally, use domain decomposition to parallelise the task.

The following packages are needed to run the notebooks.
- Jupyter
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch
- mpi4py

Analysis of each notebook can be found at the end.
